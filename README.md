# CSS-Mobile-Device-Modelling
A CSS only file that models different mobile device brands.
This approach will act as a sort of vector image for websites that make use of mobile devices for styling purpose.
It will save computing resources greatly and has the added flexibility of picking on varying colors as you may prefer.
